# Fictional Goggles 
## Bookshelf using Open Library

Implementation of a simple bookshelf using the OpenLibrary API. Users should be able to search for books and see results with a cover image, book title, and author information. 
There should be an “add” button in the search results for each book to add it to the bookshelf, unless the book is already in the bookshelf. 
Similarly, include a “remove” button to remove books from the bookshelf.
